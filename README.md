This is an expo project ejected to be managed in Xcode.

Each iOS widget is an individual extension (which is necesarry to have individual widget titles and descriptions). The iOS widget files can be found <a href="./ios-widgets">here</a>.

The main app is written with JavaScript in App.js. Run in an React Native Expo environment (or any environment that would support App.js) to test. (Android and iOS)

View the quotes, and corresponding php script to fetch them, <a href="./server-side">here</a>.

I can't upload the entire project since there is confindental information in the files, such as apple developer IDs and more.

Feel free to contribute! I wrote instructions for the widget design <a href="./android-widgets/README.md">here!</a>
