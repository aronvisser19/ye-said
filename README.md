This is an expo project ejected to run in Xcode.

Each widget is an individual extension (which is necesarry to have individual widget titles and descriptions).

The main app is written with JavaScript in App.js. Run in an React Native Expo environment to test. (Android and iOS)

The widgets are in the 'widgets' folder, written in swift. (iOS only)

I can't upload the entire project since there is confindental information in the files, such as apple developer IDs and more.
